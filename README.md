### This is an assignment for the second year of my university course!

# The Challenge
##### My task is to create a Java Database Management System for a company called Chesneys Fireplaces

# System Requirements

•	Add a new supplier to the Catalogue :white_check_mark:

•	Add a new item (fireplace) to the Catalogue – the supplier of the item must already be in the Catalogue and must be specified when the item is added :white_check_mark:

•	Lists details of suppliers and items :white_check_mark:

•	Update the quantity in stock for an item :white_check_mark:

•	Change the supplier for an item – the new Supplier must already be in the Catalogue :white_check_mark:

•	Delete Supplier and item details :white_check_mark:

# How the requirements relate to java

> Utilisation of Object Oriented Principles and Practices (Enscapsulation :white_check_mark:, Inheritance :white_check_mark:, Polymorphism :construction:, Interfaces :construction:)

> A link to a database with the ability to interact with it in any way necessary (full CRUD) :white_check_mark:

> A GUI for the application with all backend functionality usable :white_check_mark:

This project is quite large scale, and as such i will create multiple iterations of it. The current version on main is a very rough skeleton of the application, but as we learn more throughout the year i intend to add these core concepts as we go: this can be found on the extra branches.
